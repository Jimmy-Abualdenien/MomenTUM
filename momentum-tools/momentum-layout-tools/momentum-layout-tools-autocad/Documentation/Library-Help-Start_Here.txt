Help: Which libraries do you need?

Because of licenses topics you have to get the following AutoCAD libraries yourself and put them into the folder:
momentum-tools\momentum-layout-tools\momentum-layout-tools-autocad\inc
Check out the AutoCAD page 
http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=18162650&siteID=123112
and get the ObjectARX libraries
http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=773204
You need the following libraries (in the inc folder)
AcCoreMgd.dll
AcCui.dll
AcDbMgd.dll
acdbmgdbrep.dll
AcDx.dll
AcMgd.dll
AcMr.dll
AcSeamless.dll
AcTcMgd.dll
AcWindows.dll
AdWindows.dll
The project should address theses files via relative references; thus, the plugin should work.
We tested the plugin with AutoCad 2018
