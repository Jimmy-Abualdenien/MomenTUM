[Jeremy Tammik](https://github.com/jeremytammik) is well experienced with the Revit API and has an extremly useful [Blog](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/) where he publishes discussions on addins. In his [Github Repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik) many helpful projects are published. A useful tool is [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup). It allows to dynamically look into Revit objects at runtime and can help understanding the RevitAPI.
