<!-- Perception models provide a pathway to reduce the amount of information that agents can perceive. -->
<!-- There are two different perception models -->
<!-- The bresenham perception model (formerly known as BlockGemetries model) and the shadow perception model. -->
<!-- The perceptionModels definition block is: -->

<perceptualModels>

	<!-- A perceptual model has a unique id for all perception models, a name and a type. -->
	<!-- At the moment here only type is:
		 Bresenham (formerly BlockGemetries)
		 Shadow -->
	<!-- The BlockingGeometries model uses shadow mapping and bresenham-lines to check if an objects is visible. -->
	<!-- If something is not visible it is visually blocked by obstacles. -->
	<perceptual id="0" name="BlockingGeometries" type="BlockingGeometries">
		<!-- The perception distance is an optional parameter. -->
		<!-- It defines the maximal distance an agent can perceive something. -->
		<!-- In case the perception distance is missing, it model will use "longest graph edge * 2" as distance. -->
		<property name="perceptionDistance" type="Double" value="100.0"/>
		<!-- The latticeId property stores the id of a lattice in the lattice models and defines the accuracy of the model -->
		<!-- If the lattivceId is missing, the model will create its own lattice with an edge size of 0.1. -->
		<property name="latticeId" type="Integer" value="0"/>
