<!-- Perception models provide a pathway to reduce the amount of information that agents can perceive. -->

<!-- The perceptionModels definition block is: -->

<perceptualModels>

	<!-- A perceptual model has a unique id for all perception models, a name and a type. -->
	<!-- At the moment here only type is:
		 BlockingGeometries -->
	<!-- The BlockingGeometries model uses shadow mapping and bresenham-lines to check if an objects is visible. -->
	<!-- If something is not visible it is visually blocked by obstacles. -->
	<perceptual id="0" name="BlockingGeometries" type="BlockingGeometries">
		<!-- The BlockingGeometries model provides a single property, the accuracy.  -->
		<!-- The accuracy defines the discretisation of the space for bresenham-line checks. -->
		<!-- The smaller the accuracy the more accurate the perception is, the bigger the less computations are needed. -->
		<property name="accuracy" type="Double" value="0.1"/>
