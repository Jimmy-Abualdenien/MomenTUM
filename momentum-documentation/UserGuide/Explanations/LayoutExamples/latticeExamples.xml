<!-- The lattice models are quite simple and used to provide lattice to other models if demanded. -->
<!-- Models that use lattice: BlockingGeometryPerception, ShadowPerception, OriginGenerator, and XtDensity -->
<!-- Lattices are defined in the lattices tag -->
<lattices>
	<!-- Each lattice has a unique lattice id,
		 a scenariId to reference the corresponding scenario in the layouts xml tag section,
		 a latticeType, which defines if a Quadratic or Hexagonal is used (at the moment only quadratic is implemented).
		 a behaviorType, which defines if lattice should be updated synchronous, use Synchronized or Unsynchronized. 
		 The behaviorType is important for some model implementation and performance.
		 a cellEdgeSize, which defines the size of the edge of a cell. -->
