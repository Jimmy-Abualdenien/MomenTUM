<!-- The lattice models are quite simple and used to provide lattice to other models if demanded. -->
<!-- The basic idea of a lattice model originates in saving memory, because lattice can be quite huge. -->
<!-- If every model generates a lattice for its one needs, this may create out of memery exceptions. -->

<!-- Lattices are defined in the lattices tag -->
<lattices>
	<!-- Each lattice has a unique lattice id,
		 a scenariId to reference the corresponding scenario in the layouts xml tag section,
		 a latticeType, which defines if a Quadratic or Hexagonal is used (at the moment only quadratic is implemented)
		 a neigborhoodType, which defines if neigborhood cells are these which touch (Touching) a cell or touch (Edge) the edges of a cell.
		 a cellEdgeSize, which defines the size of the edge of a cell-->
